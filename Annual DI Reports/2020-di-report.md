## Analysis + Steps Forward

:white_check_mark: **Monthly Social Audits**

In 2020, I was able to achieve an audit of all my social feeds once a month. I set goals for better LGBTQ+ and BIPOC representation in my feeds. Some months I achieved those goals and some I didn’t. Each time I failed to reach a goal, I made a plan to do better the next month. Even so, this largely was really inconsistent over the year and month to month. So, though I achieved the regular audits, I wasn’t able to consistently achieve the goals identified through those audits.

So, in 2021 I plan to streamline my process for these monthly social audits. Right now, these audits are very manual and subjective in some areas. I want to narrow down what it is I’m tracking across platforms that I’m regularly posting to, and stick to real data, rather than subjective/anecdotal data.

<br>

:yellow_circle: **Quarterly Website Audits**

Given that I spent a huge portion of the year building a new website, with all new copy, as well as the fact that my D+I policies were new as of halfway through the year, quarterly website audits just simply didn’t occur in 2020. However, for 2021, I plan to complete these, and they will follow the guidelines outlined in my D+I Policies, as well as tracking and testing other non-D+I focused areas.

<br>

:white_check_mark: **Interviewing of Second Shooters + Other Subcontractors**

In 2020, I created a questionnaire that all second shooters that work with NJP would have to fill out moving forward. I not only sent this to new folks interested in second shooting with me, but also individuals who had already shot with me in the past and were already lined up to shoot with me for upcoming events. Every single person filled out the questionnaire and through it I was able to ensure that all my second shooters practice inclusivity and align with NJP values in this area.

For other subcontractors, no formal questionnaire was completed, but I had multiple candid conversations with anyone and everyone who NJP paid for any kind of contracted work to ensure an alignment with my D+I policies and core values.

<br>

:white_check_mark: **Contract Clause**

All NJP contracts (wedding, event, portrait, second shooter, etc) now include a clause which states:

> In the event that Photographer identifies any inappropriate, threatening, hostile, racist, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, misogynistic, or otherwise hateful or offensive behavior directed at them or their employees, contractors, agents, or other, Photographer reserves the right to end photography, retain all fees paid by the Client, and hold no further responsibilities to the Client.

> Photographer agrees to notify the Client of any of the above listed behaviors, and give them an opportunity to correct such behaviors, or remove the offending individuals from the session prior to ending photography

<br>

:white_check_mark: **Two Paid Workshops a Year**

In 2020, I attend two workshops focused on social justice and anti-racism in particular: “Am I Doing the Work” by Tomayia Colvin and “Decolonizing the Wedding Industry” by Empress Rules. Both workshops focused on racism in the wedding industry in particular. Moving into 2021, I aim to continue achieving this goal, but want to update the wording of my D+I Policy from just saying “Two PAID workshops a year” to something that more directly commits me to attending two workshops a year that focus on and/or are hosted by those who are negatively impacted by the wedding industry as it stands. This could mean further anti-racism workshops, workshops focused on improving LGBTQ+ representation in the industry, seminars on fighting anti-Trans trends in the industry, etc.

<br>

:white_check_mark: **Inclusive Practices for Workshops, Styled Shoots, etc**

In 2020, there was very little opportunity for workshops and styled shoots, because COVID prevented us from gathering. That said, I did attend some virtual workshops, two of which were mentioned in the “Two Paid Workshops a Year” section. Being that those were specifically focused on D+I and inclusivity, they definitely fit into this particular goal. Another workshop/class that I ended up investing and participating in was Adventure Instead’s Elopement Photographer Course. Adventure Instead have a history of making public statements and implementing practices that align with NJP’s values in creating inclusivity and improving the wedding/elopement industry in terms of diversity and inclusion. They have a statement at the bottom of every page on their website that explicitly states they support and shoot LGBTQ+ elopements. Through all this, I was able to determine that Adventure Instead’s values align with my own and therefore participating in the Elopement Photographer Course is in alignment with this policy.

<br>

:yellow_circle: **Vendor Referral List**

My D+I policy calls for keeping a vendor referral list that achieves at least 50% representation of underrepresented folx (BIPOC, LGBTQ+, woman-owned, etc). In 2020, I admittedly barely looked at my vendor referral list. 2020 was a very figure-it-out-as-I-go year, and as such I was both 1) not referring out much because events were fewer due to COVID and 2) when I was referring, primarily referring to folks I was in close virtual contact with through COVID. So, I failed to manage or maintain an official vendor referral list for this particular policy goal. However, I *did* refer out to more diverse vendors than I ever have in any other year. Somehow, through 2020, I’ve been able to connect with and build relationships with folks that I hadn’t before, many of whom identify as belonging to underrepresented groups in the industry. And so, in 2021, I plan to officially update and regularly manage a true vendor referral list and work towards referring out to that original 50% underrepresented goal.

<br>

:yellow_circle: **Networking Events Focused on and/or Hosted by Underrepresented Groups**

In 2020, there wasn’t much in the way of networking events, as we were all isolated for most of the year. There were some virtual events, and arguably, some of the workshops I attended sort of worked towards this goal, but I didn’t attend any events in 2020 that were specifically “networking” events. 

In 2021, I aim to attend at least 2 networking events, probably virtual since COVID is still part of our reality, that align with this goal. 

<br>

:yellow_circle: **25% Advertising Spend on Social Justice Focused Orgs**

I actually didn’t even come close to hitting this goal in 2020. There’s a couple reasons for it. First, the only place I paid for advertising that was specifically focused on what this goal specifically calls out (“sites, publications, and organizations that are focused on social justice and equity in the wedding industry”) was Equally Wed. Spend there came to 5% of my total advertising spend in 2020. In looking at my advertising spend numbers, what I realized  is that making a goal of 25% advertising spend going to orgs solely focused on equity in the wedding industry may not be realistic. The fact is, there are very few organizations that exist as advertising platforms that also have the primary business goal of improving representation and equity in the wedding industry. So, instead, in 2021 I'm going to update this goal to be at least 50% of ad spend going towards organizations that show and act in ways that prove a commitment to social justice and equity in general (not just in the wedding space) and make D+I a clear part of their business practices. This gives me room for improvement, but also makes the goal more achievable.

<br>

:white_check_mark: **Ensure Directories Where I Spend Advertising Dollars Align with NJP’s D+I Values**

Because of what I learned about the previous goal above (25% ad spend on social justice orgs), that goal essentially gets updated to what this goal’s original intent was - which is to ensure that whatever company I’m giving money to for advertising has D+I policies in place that align with my core values. As such, it now makes sense to consolidate these two goals into one.

Moving into 2021, under the “Advertising Spend + Outreach” category, I will have a single goal of ensuring that at least 50% of my ad spend for the year goes to organizations that act in ways that prove a commitment to social justice and equity and who make D+I a clear part of their business practices. 



## Summary

In 2020, I achieved 60% of my D+I policy goals. Given that these policies were enacted halfway through the year, in a tumultuous and uncertain time, I want to acknowledge that achievement - to an extent. That said, I think it’s important to be setting achievable goals overall, and I know I can do so much better than this moving forward. I look forward to continuing to learn, doing the hard work, and improving in 2021.
